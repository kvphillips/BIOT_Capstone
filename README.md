# BIOT_Capstone
The following files need to all be in the same folder location for you to produce the model yourself:
1) all_metabolites_ner_model_v7.py
2) condensed_metabolite_output.txt
3) ner_model_v6.py
However, I have uploaded the actual model as of 09/27/23. If the model is updated with additional information
I will update the model in github if it changes
